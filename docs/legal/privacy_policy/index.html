<h1 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to our app! We prioritize the privacy and security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your data. Our app relies on Google’s Firebase services for key functionality, and as such, Google is responsible for collecting and processing certain types of data. For more details on Firebase’s privacy practices, please refer to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">Firebase’s Privacy and Security documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2>
<p>Our app does not collect any personal information beyond what Firebase already collects to provide its services. Firebase collects data such as IP addresses, device identifiers, and other technical information necessary for app functionality. This data is processed and stored by Google in accordance with their privacy policies, which you can view <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="anonymized-usage-data">Anonymized Usage Data</h3>
<p>In addition to the data collected by Firebase, we may collect and save usage data related to your progress in the app. For example, as you vote on policies, we save your progress so that you can return and pick up where you left off.</p>
<p>If you are logged in anonymously (using Firebase’s anonymous authentication), we can track your progress and allow you to return to your last session only as long as Firebase Authentication can identify you through the anonymous ID assigned to your device. If you clear your device’s data or Firebase can no longer identify you, we will no longer be able to retrieve your progress.</p>
<p>If you sign in with a non-anonymous method, such as using your email, we associate your progress with a user token generated by Firebase. While Firebase may attach this token to your email address, the usage data we collect is stored separately and referenced only via the token, not your email or any other personally identifiable information. This allows us to reload your progress without directly referencing your email, ensuring that your identifiable information remains protected.</p>
<p>All usage data we collect, whether tied to an anonymous or non-anonymous account, remains anonymized in the sense that it is stored without directly referencing personal identifiers like your email. This data is used solely for improving app functionality and providing aggregated statistics. No personally identifiable information will be shared.</p>
<h2 id="data-use">Data Use</h2>
<p>The data we collect through Firebase and the anonymized usage data we collect is used to: - Provide essential app functionality - Ensure the security and integrity of the app - Improve the app experience or produce educational insights through aggregated, anonymized usage statistics</p>
<h2 id="data-sharing">Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not share your personal data with third parties, except as necessary to provide the services outlined above through Firebase. Google, as a service provider, processes data on our behalf in compliance with applicable laws and their own privacy policies.</p>
<h2 id="user-rights">User Rights</h2>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, such as the right to access, correct, or delete your information. Since we rely on Firebase for data processing, you can also refer to Firebase’s privacy policies for information on how to manage your data.</p>
<p>To request deletion of any personal data we collect directly (such as anonymized usage data), please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@baye.ca">support@baye.ca</a></p>
<h2 id="data-security">Data Security</h2>
<p>We and our service providers (Firebase) take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. Data transmitted between our app and Firebase is encrypted in transit, and certain services also encrypt data at rest.</p>
<h2 id="changes-to-this-policy">Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or to comply with legal requirements. We encourage you to review this page periodically for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
